An April day can bring us rain
And rain can bring us flowers.
No wonder people like to see
Those rainy April showers!

Five little cats are playing on the floor.
One runs away – and now they are four.
Four little cats are hiding in the tree.
One runs away – and now there are three.
Three little cats are walking at the Zoo.
One runs away – and now there are two.
Two little cats are lying in the sun.
One runs away – and now there is one.
